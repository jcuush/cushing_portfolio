# cushing_portfolio

In this project I personalized a portfolio website for myself.  Using layouts from bootstrap I created a navbar with functioning links to an "About", "Portfolio", and "Contact" sections.  Additionally I was able to edit the style and information in the pages.  I was also able to successfully link images from my local computer to the cloud and create a repo.
